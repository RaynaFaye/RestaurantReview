# RestaurantReview

This is the 7th project made during my front end developer course.

The project was to make a restaurant review site using google maps.

This project uses Javascript and jQuery.

Once the user has accepted to be localised, the map shows a selection of restaurants in the user's area.
If the user selects a restaurants, the site will bring the user below the map to get reviews of the restaurants and be able to add his own.
Currently, there is no backend to the project so reviews cannot be saved.
